Connect Genmitsu GGW-UART module with UGS or Candle running on a PC

The Genmitsu CNC machines utilize GRBL firmware, with G-code instructions transmitted over a serial interface. Typically, the machine's GRBL controller connects to a PC via a USB cable, which appears as a COM port on the system. CNC software, such as UGS (https://winder.github.io/ugs_website), communicates with the machine through this COM port to send G-code commands. While the USB connection provides a fast and reliable link to the machine, having a computer physically tethered to the machine in a shop environment can be inconvenient. A wireless connection would be a more practical solution.

In addition to the USB interface, Genmitsu machines typically feature a connector for an Offline Control Module or a Wireless Wi-Fi Module. This connector is a simple UART interface with RX, TX, GND, and +5 VCC pins. The [Genmitsu GGW-U232 Wireless Wi-Fi Module Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1BZ987W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) enables a wireless connection to the machine via an app (available for iOS or Android). The app provides a clean and intuitive interface, allowing users to upload G-code, jog the machine, and more. However, it lacks features such as design creation and visual monitoring that UGS offers. This project aims to connect the Genmitsu PROVerXL 4030 with the GGW-U232 Wireless Wi-Fi Module to a PC running UGS.
